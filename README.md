**W202 data visualization:**  
  
  _contributors:_ April Kim, Harry Xu, Jae Lee, Jesse Calvillo  
  _users:_ anyone interested in wine  
  _data:_  wine review and wine export data  
  _tasks:_ explore the relationship between *quantity* and *quality* of wine around the world  
  _insights:_ e.g. "italy exports more wines than spain but on average they are rated lower quality"

### general idea / description
The general idea is to take a set of wine review data and do exploratory data analysis.
Based on these insights, create a visualization that can demonstrate these insights interactively to the user in different ways.

### 1. scrollytelling
- geographical map
- explanatory text (insights)

### 2. tree-map [to be decided] 
- size of rectangle is scaled with proportion of reviews,
- each rectangle would have an “average overall score”, and
- a callout would list “average scores by varietal” .. or something like that.

### 3. weighted scatterplot
- geographical location (number of wines-reviews in a country)
- average wine score
- filter: wine type

### 4. chloropleth map [to be decided]
- threshold quantized, or linear color scale for each country
- hover details

# log

**[7 June 2018]** -jlc    
  We can keep track of updates + tasks on this README.  
  Basic web structure (html, css, js) created.  
  Readme created.  
  
  Let's discuss this weekend when we get together:  
  - Ideas for this // should we do it as-proposed or are there other things everyone is interested in?  
  - Shall we devide the work (one team working on scrollytelling+map, tree-map, scatterplot)?  
  - Basic timeline for project  
  - What days work for people in general to meet?  
  - Set out initial tasks  

**[10 June 2018]** -jlc    
  Nothing was over 100MB; added the data/ folder   
  idea: if this goes well, we can use probably use `github pages` and jekyll (python) to host the site for free.  
  - added a chloropleth with dummy data and hover function as a stand-in
