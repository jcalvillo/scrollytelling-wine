### general idea / description
The general idea is to take a set of wine review data and do exploratory data analysis.
Based on these insights, create a visualization that can demonstrate these insights interactively to the user.

1. scrollytelling
2. tree-map
3. weighted scatterplot



### scrollytelling
- geographical map
- explanatory text (insights)

### tree-map
- size of rectangle is scaled with proportion of reviews,
- each rectangle would have an “average overall score”, and
- a callout would list “average scores by varietal” .. or something like that.

### weighted scatterplot
- geographical location (number of wines-reviews in a country)
- average wine score
- filter: wine type

# log

[7 June 2018]
  This is our scrollytelling-wine project.
  We can keep track of updates + tasks on this README.
  There is a basic web structure (html, css, js) here already.

  Let's discuss this weekend when we get together:
  - Ideas for this // should we do it as-proposed or are there other things everyone is interested in?
  - Are we scraping new data down from the website? #python
  - Shall we devide the work (one team working on scrollytelling+map, tree-map, scatterplot)?
  - Basic timeline for project
  - What days work for people in general to meet?
  - Set out initial tasks
