                <div class="title">Varietals</div>
                Wine is made with grapes, but not typical table grapes you’ll find at the grocery. Wine grapes (latin name: Vitis vinifera)
                have thick skins, are small, sweet, and contain seeds. There are over a thousand kinds of wine grapes planted around the world.

                <div class="title">Regions</div>
                Wine is made in virtually every country in the world. These countries are often referred to as “Old World” or “New World.”
                “Old World” consists of regions with long histories of wine production, such as Europe and parts of the Mediterranean.
                Some of the most well-known “Old World” wine regions include France, Italy and Germany, and these regions focus greatly
                on terroir—the unique characteristics of the soil and climate, which give their wine a sense of place. “New World”
                is used to describe newer wine-producing regions, such as U.S., Australia and Chile.
                These regions tend to have hotter climates and generally use different labeling methods; they tend to use grapes
                rather than region on labels for recognition.

                <div class="title">Blends and Single Varietals</div>
               Some countries are famous for producing one varietal while other countries have different sub-regions - each renowned for
                an unique blend. As an example, Bordeaux, a classic region in France, is typically a blend of the varietals
                Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.

                <div class="title">How to Taste Wine</div>
                The ability to sniff out and untangle the subtle threads that weave into complex wine aromas is essential for tasting.
                Try holding your nose while you swallow a mouthful of wine; you will find that most of the flavor is muted. Your nose is the key to your palate.
                Once you learn how to give wine a good sniff, you’ll begin to develop the ability to isolate flavors—to notice the way
                they unfold and interact—and, to some degree, assign language to describe them.

            <section class="step">
                <div class="title">Pairing Wines</div>
                Wine flavors are derived from specific components: sugar, acid, fruit, tannin and alcohol.
                Foods also have flavor components, such as fat, acid, salt, sugar and bitter.
                The most successful food and wine pairings feature complementary components, richness and textures.
                You can try for either a similar pairing or a contrasting one. For pasta in a rich cream sauce, for example,
                you could cut through the creamy fat with a crisp, dry, unoaked white wine. Or you could wrap the flavor of the
                wine around the richness of the sauce by choosing a big, ripe, soft Chardonnay or Roussanne/Marsanne blend.
                Of course you’ll need to brush up on white wine and red wine basics  to understand the flavors of each grape.
